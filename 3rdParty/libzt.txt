commit: 48d8dccff83ce0c0952c5c0059a34de349cace41

Known problems:
 * In some files lwip heades and in other files native headers are included.
 * The destruction of the concurrent queue is not thread-safe, which sometimes
   results in an unclean shutdown.
 * ZeroTier.h needs <sys/socket.h> on Linux.
